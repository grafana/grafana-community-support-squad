# Community Support Squad Discussion Topics (DRAFT)

## Who are we?

The community support team helps the community via github and discourse community forums to offer support to our free and oss users. Many of the easy questions in the community get answered first. Users of more advanced features come to us with questions that are more difficult to answer. 

## How can we help each other?

Community feedback shows us how we can improve the user experience through documentation, bug fixes, usability improvements, feature requests, and give insight into use cases.

We want to create a way for the community support squad and developers to share knowledge to benefit our users.

## How does this meeting work? 

The community support squad memebers works on different day to day tasks and it could be helpful to share the knowledge as what they had been working on. For e.g.

- A community post or GitHub issue which took time to resolve and understand it
- A community post or GitHub issue which needs to be discussed together
- Someone new you have learned (e.g. a tool, script, command etc.) and want to share the knowledge with the team.

**Types of issues to discuss and partner on:** 
- Tough issues where a user and support engineer could benefit from a developerâ€™s knowledge to solve and learn
- Highlight interesting use cases, bugs, themes, or feature requests

**Meeting format:**
- 30 to 60 minutes weekly
- Complete the table below to provide the list of topics you want to bring for discussion
- We'll post the agenda two days in advance here in github
